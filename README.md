# OCaml-Quantor

Binding to the [quantor](http://fmv.jku.at/quantor/) QBF solver. The solver
itself and [Picosat (version 535)](http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/) are packaged with
the library for convenience (they are rarely packaged on distributions, and
require some compilation options such as `-fPIC` to work with OCaml).

## License

The library and its dependencies are licensed under the BSD license
(and the MIT license for picosat), which is fairly permissive.

## Installation

Use opam.
